    <h1>Hello! Welcome to Autocode</h1>
    <p>
      This is a sample HTML file. Files in the <code>www/</code> directory will
      automatically be converted into static webpages and resources.
    </p>
    <h2>Indexes</h2>
    <p>
      <code>index.html</code> / <code>index.htm</code> are special. They refer
      to the root directory and will be available at <code>[example.com/service]/</code>
      as well as <code>[example.com/service]/index.html</code>.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Note:</strong> <code>[example.com/service]</code> means your service
      URL, usually something like <code>username.api.stdlib.com/service@env</code>,
      though you can define custom hostnames in your dashboard.
    </p>
    <h2>404 Error Pages (Not Found)</h2>
    <p>
      Name a file <code>404.html</code> / <code>404.htm</code> to create a
      404 (not found) handler for a specific directory. It will automatically
      apply to any directory above it unless there's a higher priority 404
      page found. This is similar to the behavior of 
      <code>functions/__notfound__.js</code> files and will compete with them
      for priority.
    </p>
    <h2>Combining Endpoints and Static Files</h2>
    <p>
      You can use serverless functions (endpoints) and static files in the same
      project by having both a <code>functions/</code> and a <code>www/</code> directory.
      Projects can not have two files with the same route, meaning you can't
      have both <code>functions/__main__.js</code> and <code>www/index.html</code>
      in the same project.
