# Algorand-Discord-Verification-Bot
 The Algorand community was lacking in a few places, and of these is free, opensource Discord bots. When I first joined the Algorand community I noticed a barrier to entry as project to attain fairly essential elements. One of these being a verification bot that allows NFT asset owners to verify their ownership as well as "flex" or show off their purchases. This is found in most large established projects and provides a fun and interactive way to participate in the community. This bot is built on the autocode discord bot hosting service and the file system in the repo matches that of the autocode filesystem.

The video tutorial for setting up the bot can be found on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/dmU6Zldwgyw
