# Algorand-Discord-Verification-Bot
 The Algorand community was lacking in a few places, and of these is free, opensource Discord bots. When I first joined the Algorand community I noticed a barrier to entry as project to attain fairly essential elements. One of these being a verification bot that allows NFT asset owners to verify their ownership as well as "flex" or show off their purchases. This is found in most large established projects and provides a fun and interactive way to participate in the community. This grant aims to fund development and improvements to the current Discord verification bot built for the Algorand community.
